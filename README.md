# Chuck Norris Cipher Encoder (Java)

## Project Details
> - **Level**: ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Challenging | **Time**: ðŸ•’ ~17 hours
> - **Course**: [Introduction to Java](https://hyperskill.org/courses/8-introduction-to-java)
> - **Project**: [Chuck Norris Cipher Encoder (Java)](https://hyperskill.org/projects/293?track=8)
> - **Description**: This project will allow us to deal with string and character variables and work with loops and 
    conditional statements. Get familiar with the binary notation and data type conversion. Create an application for 
    the unary representation and decoding of any text.

## About
Secret agents use encryption all the time. You know that everything can be encrypted as different characters. What about 
encryption that uses only one character and space? This method has a name â€” the Chuck Norris cipher. In this project, you 
will create a program that can encrypt any text into a sequence of zeros and spaces and decrypt this sequence into text.
