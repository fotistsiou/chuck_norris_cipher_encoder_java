/**
 * Try to understand it
 * --------------------
 * Description
 * In this stage, you will write a decoder for a cipher. You need to transform the encrypted message into its original format.
 * --------------------
 * Objectives
 * Your program receives a string of zeros and spaces and converts it to readable text. You must parse the string to the
 * blocks of zeroes and decode the message the same way as in previous stages but in reversed order.
 * For example, your program receives 0 0 00 0000 0 000 00 0000 0 00. You can split blocks of zeros and group those
 * blocks by two. Then you need to decode these blocks like in the previous stage:
 *  - 0 0 is 1
 *  - 00 0000 is 0000
 *  - 0 000 is 111
 *  - 00 0000 is 0000
 *  - 0 00 is 11
 * Concatenation of the lines above gives us 10000111000011.
 * After that, you need to split the result into blocks of seven symbols (binary form) and convert these blocks to
 * characters. In this case, splitting 10000111000011 by seven symbols gives us two characters â€” 1000011 1000011 ,
 * convert them into characters and the result will be CC (C is 1000011).
 * In this stage, your program should:
 *  1. Read a string from a console. The input contains a single line of spaces and 0 characters.
 *  2. Print The result: line, followed by a line with a decoded message.
 * The Integer.parseInt() method might be useful at this stage.

        // 2. \\G: Matches the end of the last match or the start of the string for the first match.
        // 3. .{7}: Matches exactly 7 characters.
        String[] characters = binaryResult.toString().split("(?<=\\G.{7})");
