/**
 * Chuck Norris encrypts only with zeros
 * -------------------------------------
 * Description
 * Binary with 0 and 1 is good, but binary with only 0 is even better! This encoding has a name — the Chuck Norris Unary Code.
 * Let's convert our text into a sequence of zeros and spaces!
 * -------------------------------------
 * Objectives
 * The encoding principle is simple. The input message consists of ASCII characters (7-bit). You need to transform the
 * text into the sequence of 0 and 1 and use the Chuck Norris technique. The encoded output message consists of blocks
 * of 0. A block is separated from another block by a space.
 * Two consecutive blocks are used to produce a series of the same value bits (only 1 or0 values):
 *  - First block: it is always 0 or 00. If it is 0, then the series contains 1, if not, it contains 0
 *  - Second block: the number of 0 in this block is the number of bits in the series
 * Let's take a simple example with a message which consists of only one character C. The C symbol in binary is represented
 * as 1000011, so with Chuck Norris technique this gives:
 *  - 0 0 (the first series consists of only a single 1);
 *  - 00 0000 (the second series consists of four 0);
 *  - 0 00 (the third consists of two 1)
 *  - So C is coded as: 0 0 00 0000 0 00
 * Make sure, that an encoding of a single character sequence is not separated. For example, 000 should be encoded as
 * 00 000 and not as 00 0 00 0 00 0 or 00 0 00 00 or 00 00 00 0
 * In this stage, your program should:
 *  1. Read a string from a console. The input contains a single line.
 *  2. Print The result: line, followed by a line with an encoded message.
